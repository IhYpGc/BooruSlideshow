# From DontTalkToMeThx:

# Notice: I will no longer be working on this. Unless something breaks, there will be no updates.

### From time to time, I still work on the [electron app](https://github.com/DontTalkToMeThx/BooruSlideshowElectron). From this point on, new features will only appear on the electron app.

The repo for the electron app can now be found [here](https://github.com/DontTalkToMeThx/BooruSlideshowElectron).
